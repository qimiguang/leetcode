 * 743. Network Delay Time
 * Difficulty:Medium
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.
 * <p>
 * Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
 * <p>
 * Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * N will be in the range [1, 100].
 * K will be in the range [1, N].
 * The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
 * All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 1 <= w <= 100.
